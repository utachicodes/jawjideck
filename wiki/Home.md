# ArduDeck

ArduDeck is a cross-platform ground control station for ArduPilot, Betaflight, and iNav flight controllers. It replaces the legacy Mission Planner (C#/.NET WinForms) with a modern Electron + React desktop app. Connect via USB serial, TCP, or UDP, configure your vehicle, plan missions, flash firmware, and monitor telemetry in real time.

## Supported Firmware

| Firmware | Protocol | Support Level |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| ArduPilot (Copter, Plane, VTOL, Rover, Boat, Sub) | MAVLink v1/v2 | Full configuration, mission planning, telemetry |
| iNav | MSP v1/v2 | PID/Rates/Modes, servo mixer, OSD, firmware flash |
| Betaflight | MSP v1/v2 | PID/Rates/Modes, firmware flash |
| Legacy boards (iNav < 2.1, Betaflight < 4.0, Cleanflight) | CLI over MSP | CLI-powered GUI |
